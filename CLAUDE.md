# Digital Home Backend

## First Time Setup

If you just cloned this repo, follow these steps in order. You need both this repo (Backend) and the [Digital Home Frontend Starter](https://github.com/lukesbrave/digital-home-frontend-starter) repo. **Set up the Frontend first** — it has the shared website migrations.

### Recommended Setup Flow

1. Create one parent folder on your machine called `digital-home`
2. Open that folder in Claude Code
3. Do the Frontend setup in **Chat 1**
4. Do the Backend setup in **Chat 2**
5. Use the **same Supabase project** for both repos

Using a separate chat for each repo helps Claude stay in the correct project context and avoids confusion between frontend and backend files, migrations, and environment variables.

Before continuing backend setup, confirm Claude is working inside `digital-home-backend-starter` and using the same Supabase project as the Frontend.

### Step 0: Check for Node.js
Before anything else, check if the user has Node.js installed by running `node -v`. If the command fails or is not found, walk them through installing it: go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), download the LTS version, and run the installer. They need Node.js to run this project.

### Step 1: Supabase + Migrations (Frontend First)
If you haven't already, follow the Frontend CLAUDE.md Steps 1-3 to create your Supabase project, run all Frontend migrations (`001` through `011`), and create an admin user. Then run this repo's migration:

- `supabase/migrations/001_backend_core.sql`

Both repos share the same database. The Frontend owns the shared website schema; this repo owns `backend_settings` and `brand_context`.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```
Fill in:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` — your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — your Supabase anon key
- `SUPABASE_URL` — runtime duplicate of your Supabase URL for Workers
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — runtime duplicate of your anon key for Workers
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — your Supabase service role key
- `DIGITAL_HOME_URL` — your Frontend's live URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
- `API_SECRET_KEY` — a shared secret you choose (must match the Frontend)
- `API_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED` — keep `true` unless you intentionally need unsigned machine requests during a migration
- `API_REQUEST_SIGNATURE_TTL_SECONDS` — optional request age limit for signed API calls (default `300`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) (for AI article writing)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) (for DALL-E hero images, optional)

### Step 3: Seed Your Brand Context
Your brand context is what makes the AI write in your voice. First, fill in your content corpus files (see the Frontend's `content-corpus-examples/` for the format). Then seed them into Supabase either:

- via the Supabase dashboard / SQL editor, or
- via the authenticated `/api/setup` route after logging into the Backend

> **⚠️ This is the most important step.** The content corpus is what separates AI that writes like you from AI that writes generic slop. A properly built corpus includes: voice guide, tone examples, content hooks, core positioning, offer architecture, competitive landscape, SEO keyword clusters, and case studies/testimonials. If you haven't completed your content corpus in the Frontend setup, do that first. If you want help building that part properly, the deeper brand intake and strategy workflow is available in the [BraveBrand community](https://www.skool.com/bravebrand).

You also need two special entries in the `brand_context` table:

**CTA Links** — the links the AI will use in article CTAs:
```
category: cta
key: links
content: (your CTA links in HTML — one per line, with descriptions of when to use each)
```

**Author Name** — the byline on articles:
```
category: identity
key: author
content: [Your Name]
```

**Image Style** — controls the AI-generated hero images for articles (uses DALL-E):
```
category: content
key: image_style
content: (your image style description — composition, color palette, lighting, mood, what to avoid)
```
If no image style is configured, the system uses a clean editorial photography default. You can describe any aesthetic — minimalist, bold, illustrated, photographic — and every generated hero image will follow it.

You can add these via the Supabase dashboard (Table Editor → brand_context → Insert row) or via the authenticated `/api/setup` endpoint.

### Step 4: Install and Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:3001` and log in with the admin user you created in Supabase.

### Step 5: Create the `images` Storage Bucket
The article writer uploads hero images to a Supabase Storage bucket named `images`.

In Supabase:
1. Go to **Storage**
2. Create a bucket named `images`
3. Make it **public** if you want article hero images to load directly on the Frontend

If you skip this step, article writing still works, but image uploads will fail gracefully and articles will publish without a hero image.

### Step 6: Deploy to Cloudflare

> **⚠️ `wrangler.jsonc` and git:** The repo ships with placeholder values in `wrangler.jsonc` (for open-source cloners). Your real Supabase URL, anon key, and domain are set **locally only** and must NOT be committed back to git. If `wrangler.jsonc` shows up in `git status` as modified, that's expected — leave it uncommitted. If you accidentally commit it, revert with `git checkout HEAD -- wrangler.jsonc` after deploying.

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
Before deploying, update `wrangler.jsonc` with your own Worker name, the `WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE.service` value, and your runtime URLs.

Then set server-side secrets:
```bash
wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY
wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
wrangler secret put DIGITAL_HOME_URL
wrangler secret put SUPABASE_URL
wrangler secret put SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```
When prompted, paste ONLY the value (not the variable name).

### Step 7: Verify Everything Works
Log into the Backend, then visit `https://your-backend-url.com/api/test-frontend` to check the Backend→Frontend connection. You should see `api_key_set: true` and `status: 200`.

For GitHub Actions and other automations, the machine-auth flow is:
- `x-api-key` — shared secret
- `x-timestamp` — current Unix timestamp in seconds
- `x-signature` — HMAC-SHA256 of `METHOD:PATH:TIMESTAMP:RAW_BODY`

The Frontend Starter workflows already generate those headers automatically.

### Step 8: Run the Full Publishing Check
Verify the full cross-repo loop in this order:
1. Run `weekly-trends.yml` from the Frontend Starter repo
2. Confirm new ideas appear in `content_calendar`
3. Approve one topic in the Backend dashboard
4. Run `daily-publish.yml`
5. Confirm the article appears in the Frontend blog as a draft or published post, based on your publish mode

## What This Is
The Digital Home Backend is the operating system behind a Digital Home. It's a standalone application that manages content, leads, email, analytics, and AI agents — replacing rented SaaS admin panels with a single, owned, agent-native system.

The Backend connects to the same Supabase database as the Digital Home Frontend Starter (the public-facing website). The Frontend is the storefront. The Backend is the back office.

**Open-source:** Any consultant or business can deploy their own Digital Home Frontend + Backend stack on their own infrastructure. The value is in your content corpus, agent prompts, and implementation expertise — not the platform code.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) — shared with the Digital Home
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (email/password, no public signup)
- **Deployment:** Cloudflare Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (OpenNext) — separate deployment from the Digital Home

## Backend Modules

### Module 1: Content Pipeline (built)
- Content calendar with status pipeline (planned → approved → writing → draft → published → archived)
- Priority management (high/medium/low)
- Publishing mode toggle (safe = drafts for review, autonomous = auto-publish)
- Bulk approve/archive actions
- Exposes API routes for article writing and trend scanning
- GitHub Actions for daily publishing and weekly trend scanning — **Note:** The workflow files live in the Frontend Starter repo (`.github/workflows/`), not here. They call the Backend's `/api/write-article` and `/api/trend-scan` routes. See the Frontend CLAUDE.md for setup instructions.

### Module 2: Lead Management (planned)
- Lead pipeline from the Digital Home's email capture forms
- Lead scoring based on visitor behavior
- Segment management
- Replaces rented CRM contacts/pipeline

### Module 3: Email Sequences (planned)
- Sequence builder and management
- Send history and analytics
- Uses Resend API (same as the Digital Home)
- Replaces rented email/automation platforms

### Module 4: Analytics (planned)
- Visitor analytics dashboard
- Content performance metrics
- Conversion tracking
- AI traffic reporting
- Replaces rented analytics dashboards

### Module 5: Agent Oversight (planned)
- Agent activity logs and audit trail
- Agent performance metrics (tokens used, actions taken, success rates)
- Manual agent triggers
- This is what no existing CRM can do

### Module 6: Knowledge Graph (planned)
- Entity management (organizations, people, services, concepts)
- Relationship mapping
- JSON-LD generation oversight
- SEO schema management

    middleware.ts        ← Auth guard — redirects to /login if no session
```

## Environment Variables

There are two types of environment variables. Getting this wrong is the most common deployment issue.

### Build-time public variables
These are baked into JavaScript at build time. They go in the Cloudflare dashboard (Settings > Variables & Secrets) AND in `wrangler.jsonc` under `vars`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL      — Supabase project URL (same as Digital Home)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY — Supabase anon key (same as Digital Home)
NEXT_PUBLIC_DIGITAL_HOME_URL  — Public site URL used for "View live" links in the dashboard
```

### Server-side secrets
These MUST be set using `wrangler secret put` from the terminal. The Cloudflare dashboard UI does NOT work for Workers secrets — only for Pages projects.
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY     — Service role key, bypasses RLS (same as Digital Home)
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY             — Duplicate of anon key for server-side access (Workers can't read NEXT_PUBLIC_ at runtime)
SUPABASE_URL                  — Duplicate of Supabase URL for server-side access (same reason)
API_SECRET_KEY                — Shared secret between Frontend and Backend (must match both)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY             — Anthropic API key for AI article writing
OPENAI_API_KEY                — OpenAI API key for DALL-E hero images
DIGITAL_HOME_URL              — The public-facing Digital Home URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com)
```

**Common mistakes when setting secrets:**
- When `wrangler secret put` prompts for a value, paste ONLY the value (e.g., `my-api-secret-key`), NOT the variable name with it (e.g., NOT `API_SECRET_KEY=my-api-secret-key`)
- `DIGITAL_HOME_URL` must be the live Frontend URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`), NOT `http://localhost:3000`
- `API_SECRET_KEY` must be identical on both the Frontend and Backend Workers
- The Frontend also needs its own secrets set via `wrangler secret put` — see the Frontend CLAUDE.md

### Verifying API connectivity
After setting all secrets, log into the Backend and test the Backend→Frontend connection by visiting:
```
https://your-backend-url.com/api/test-frontend
```
This returns the Frontend URL, API key status, and whether the Frontend responds. Check:
- `api_key_set` should be `true`
- `status` should be `200`
If `status` is `401`, the API key doesn't match between Backend and Frontend. Re-set it on both.

## Important Conventions
- **Auth required on all pages** except `/login`. Middleware handles the redirect.
- **No public signup.** Admin users are created directly in Supabase dashboard.
- **Protected API routes for admin data.** The dashboard should read and write admin tables through authenticated Next API routes, not browser-side Supabase queries.
- **Digital Home API** for content writes that need shared-site side effects (e.g., publishing content triggers SEO metadata generation in the Frontend).
- **Route auth split:**
  - session-only: admin dashboard APIs (`/api/articles`, `/api/content-calendar`, `/api/publish`, `/api/reset-writing`, `/api/settings`, `/api/setup`, `/api/test-frontend`)
  - session or signed API request: machine-triggered automation routes (`/api/write-article`, `/api/write-now`, `/api/trend-scan`)
- **Dark theme only.** This is a professional dashboard, not a consumer app.
- **CRITICAL — Shared database types:** When you modify `src/types/database.ts` or add/change a Supabase migration, you MUST also update the same `src/types/database.ts` file in the Digital Home Frontend Starter repo. These two files must always be identical.

## Cloudflare / OpenNext Rules

This project runs on Cloudflare Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (OpenNext). The older `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` adapter is **deprecated and incompatible**. If you see `next-on-pages` in tutorials, ignore it — the two systems want opposite things. These rules prevent build failures:

### NEVER add edge runtime exports
Do **not** add `export const runtime = 'edge'` to any route file. OpenNext handles runtime assignment itself and **rejects** manual edge runtime exports. This is the #1 cause of broken builds. Old Cloudflare tutorials recommend this pattern — it does not apply here.

### NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars don't exist at runtime on Workers
Cloudflare Workers can only read `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables at build time (they're baked into the JS bundle). At runtime on the server, they're `undefined`. This is why:
- `wrangler.jsonc` has both `SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` in `vars`
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` uses the fallback pattern: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || process.env.SUPABASE_URL`
- When creating new server-side code that reads env vars, always use this fallback pattern for any `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable

### Always run `npm run build` before pushing
`next dev` does not catch all TypeScript errors. `next build` does. Always build locally before pushing to catch errors that would fail the Cloudflare build.

### New Supabase tables must be in the types file
If you add a new table to Supabase but don't add it to `src/types/database.ts`, the production build will fail with TypeScript errors. Either add the table to the types file or use `as any` as a temporary escape hatch.

### Build artifacts must stay out of git
These directories are generated during builds and must never be committed:
```
.vercel/
.open-next/
.wrangler/
```

### The build command is `npm run build`
Do **not** use `npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages@1` or any other build command. Wrangler's deploy step handles the OpenNext conversion automatically after a standard Next.js build.

### Secrets must be set via Wrangler CLI
Server-side secrets (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) must be set using `wrangler secret put`. The Cloudflare dashboard UI only works for Pages projects, not Workers. Secrets set via Wrangler take effect immediately without a rebuild.

## Decision Log

### Dashboard as separate app
- **Decision:** Split the admin dashboard out of the Digital Home into a standalone Backend app
- **Why:** The Frontend is the client-facing storefront. The Backend is the operating system — content management, lead tracking, email, analytics, agent oversight. Keeping them separate means: (1) the Frontend stays lean and fast, (2) the Backend can be open-sourced independently, (3) every deployment gets two apps — public site + private backend, (4) own the entire stack, replace rented platforms with owned infrastructure.
- **Alternatives considered:** Admin pages inside the Digital Home. Rejected because it conflates the public-facing site with the back office, makes open-sourcing harder, and doesn't scale to a multi-module platform.

### Open-source architecture
- **Decision:** Design the Backend for open-source from day one
- **Why:** The moat is the content corpus, agent prompts, and implementation expertise — not the platform code. Open-sourcing: (1) builds trust and authority, (2) creates a community of contributors, (3) establishes the standard for AI-native digital infrastructure.
